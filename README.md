# lazy-logs

Hi, my name is Paul, and Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer. lazy-logs, my largest and most ambitious full-stack application to date, replicates key Airbnb functionalities, allowing users to book properties, browse listings across Romania, and manage their accounts. The design is welcoming and modern, with an user-friendly interface that ensures a great experience for potential customers.

## Final thoughts

This was a truly challenging project. Over the course of two months, I revised and researched numerous concepts, features, and principles I had previously learned in online courses. My goal was to apply everything I learned so far from Jonas Schmedtmann's courses, which made me start this whole journey. I tried to make good use of every bit of knowledge I gained, striving to optimize and refine every aspect to the best of my ability.

I encountered numerous challenges and bugs that sometimes took days to overcome. The design aspect was particularly difficult, as I often struggled to visualize how all the elements would come together. Deploying the website to Vercel was truly a trial by fire, as you can see in the commit history, due to the poor documentation available for deploying full-stack applications on the platform.

I am really proud of this
