It felt like we were left on our own with no proper instructions or guidance on how to manage the place. The photos didn't reflect the reality of the cabin, which was quite rundown. We left earlier than planned because we couldn't enjoy the stay."

Additionally, the Wi-Fi didn't work, which was a major inconvenience since we needed it for work. The cabin is in a beautiful location, but the lack of proper management made the stay uncomfortable. The place needs maintenance, and it was clear that it hadn't been cleaned properly before our arrival. I wouldn’t return unless some serious improvements were made."

The views of the surrounding mountains were breathtaking, and the location was ideal for anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.

However, these were minor inconveniences in an otherwise pleasant stay. We especially enjoyed the firepit outside, where we spent our evenings. I would recommend this place for a peaceful and scenic retreat."

			"comment": "The cabin was a wonderful place to escape for the weekend. We loved the rustic feel of the place, and it had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location was ideal for hiking and outdoor activities, and we were able to enjoy the beautiful scenery. The only downside was that the cabin could use a bit of updating, especially the kitchen appliances and the bathroom. But overall, we had a fantastic time and would consider coming back in the future."

The host was attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed. We spent a lot of time by the fireplace, which added to the cozy atmosphere. The kitchen was well-equipped, although we wished there were more pots and pans for cooking. The Wi-Fi wasn’t the best, but it didn’t matter too much because we spent most of our time outdoors. Overall, it was a great stay and we would definitely recommend it to others."

The cabin was well-stocked with basic supplies, though we would have appreciated a few more kitchen tools for cooking. We did run into a small issue with the heating, but the host was quick to respond and had it fixed in no time. All in all, it was a great experience, and we’re already planning to come back next year."
